      "A scan walks a folder and prints what it found. Nothing is stored, nothing is changed.",

      "Unreadable paths are counted and sampled rather than stopping the walk. On macOS, reaching outside your home folder needs Full Disk Access for your terminal; without it the scan still completes and tells you what it missed.",

    startExclude:
      "--exclude takes a directory name, not a path, and repeats. Excluded folders are never descended into, so excluding node_modules on a developer machine is usually the difference between two seconds and thirty.",

    snapBody:
      "This is the part other analysers do not have. Save a scan, save another one later, and ask what changed between them.",

    culpritTitle: "Why it names the deepest folder",
    culpritBody:
      "A folder whose growth comes entirely from one child tells you nothing you did not already know, so it is skipped. The report names the first level where the change genuinely spreads out — the culprit, not its ancestors.",

    agentTitle: "The agent on a server",
    agentBody:
      "spacetrace-agent is the same code as a service: it scans the roots you configure on a schedule, keeps the snapshots, and answers over HTTP. It is one static binary, and it only ever reads — there is no code path in it that deletes anything outside its own snapshot database.",
    agentStep1: "Write a config and a token",
    agentStep1Body:
      "serve refuses to start without a token. An unauthenticated agent hands its whole filesystem inventory to anyone who can reach the port.",
    agentStep2: "Say what to scan and when",
    agentStep2Body:
      "Five cron fields, with *, a-b, */n and lists. No seconds, no @daily. Unknown config keys are rejected at startup, because a typo that silently does nothing on a machine nobody watches is worse than a refusal to boot.",
    agentStep3: "Check before you start it",
    agentStep3Body:
      "A schedule that can never fire reports never rather than failing quietly.",
    agentStep4: "Run it",
    agentStep4Body:
      "The bundled systemd unit runs the agent as its own unprivileged user under ProtectSystem=strict, at Nice=10 with idle I/O priority. A scan should never get in the way of what the machine is actually for.",

      "It binds loopback by default. Publishing a filesystem inventory to a network should be a deliberate edit.",
      "There is no TLS in the agent. Put a reverse proxy in front of it.",

      "/health needs no token so a container healthcheck works, and returns only status and version — no hostname, no roots.",
      "Ad-hoc scans are off. With them on, anyone holding the token can enumerate any directory the agent's user can read.",

    remoteTitle: "Reading another machine",
    remoteBody:
      "Any read-only command takes --remote. Nothing new has to be learned: the same subcommands, pointed elsewhere.",
    remoteSaveBody:
      "Save a remote so the URL and token stop being typed — in ~/.config/spacetrace/remotes.toml:",
    remoteNotDifferentTitle: "A remote snapshot is not a different kind of thing",
    remoteNotDifferentBody:
      "What comes down the wire is the same standalone SQLite file the agent stores, so listing, browsing and diffing it run the identical code as a local snapshot. You can skip the tool entirely and still get a file you can open:",

    sizeDiverge:
      "They diverge in both directions and both are right. A one-byte file allocates a whole block, so it is bigger on disk than its length. A sparse file reports a length it never allocated: a disk image can claim a terabyte and hold nineteen gigabytes.",
    sizeWhyOnDisk:
      "Sparse files are why the app defaults to on disk. Virtual machine images, database files and core dumps are among the largest entries on any real disk, so the logical measure is most wrong about exactly the entries that matter most. The command line defaults to logical, and both say which one they are showing.",
    sizeCapacityWhy:
      "Capacity is reported as free of total, never as “% used”. On a filesystem whose space is shared between volumes — an APFS container, btrfs subvolumes, thin LVM — a used figure would include the siblings and disagree with df about the same mount.",
